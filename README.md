**News Sentiment**

​	In this assignment, over 100 unique tweets of  5 different popular News Accounts were downloaded via the Tweepy API. The tweets were then assessed with the Vader  **(Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** Sentiment library to determine if the tweets were positive, negative or neutral. A compounded score is also given to assess the tweets at a quick glance.

​	Without directly looking at each tweet, it can be observed that the tweets tweeted out by these news accounts are computed to negative by Vader.  BBC World News was the most negative with a score of -0.15 followed by CBS with a score of -0.13. Fox and NYT both scored during this API download a positive score of 0.02.

​	Despite the average tweets being more negative, not all tweets were negative. Without doing any analysis one could see that there is a fairly even distribution of positive and negative tweets.
